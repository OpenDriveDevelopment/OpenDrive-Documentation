The diagram illustrates the architecture of the OpenDrive Framework, structured into three main modules: Sensors and Preprocessing, Perception, and Decision-Making. Each module plays a distinct role in processing data for autonomous driving. The Sensors and Preprocessing Module gathers and prepares data from various sensors. The Perception Module analyzes this data to detect lanes, objects, traffic signs, and free space. Finally, the Decision-Making Module uses the insights to generate actionable alerts and classifications, providing essential metadata to assist driving decisions. This modular design ensures scalability and flexibility for future enhancements.
